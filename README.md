# ProjectTemplate

This is a personal project. I'm currently working on the project 'Project 5/6'. We are developing a testsystem for Venadium Redox Flow Batteries. We're at the stage that Potentially Shippable Product (PSP) is almost finished. Because of this, we are more concerned with documenting the process, than with finishing the product.

It seems a good idea to get a clear picture about what documenting is all about. It is for this reason, that I want to make a template, I can use in this course and further courses. The template will contain all kinds of documents. I've listed what I want to include below, in the Table of Content. Some documents will always be used, in every project. Others are only nessecary for certain projects. For example, an Entity Relationship Diagram is not needed if the PSP (Potentially Shippable Product) does not interact with or uses any database.

The first version came out on January 7th, 2023. It was uploaded to Github on January 8th. The most recent version can also be found at [tdregmans.nl/ProjectTemplate.pdf](http://tdregmans.nl/ProjectTemplate.pdf)
